Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I designed was a simple inventory application for android mobile devices. Some requirements I needed to meet were:
-Including a username and login screen with the ability for registration 
-The ability to Create, read, write, and delete inventory. These items include name and quantity 
-The integration of SMS alerts when Items are low(quantity 0)

The user needs that were addressed was a simple inventory app that can help keep track of items. This was the basis of a bare bones application that can be expanded on
It has all the basic necessities and laid the foreground for expansion as needed. The beauty of this app lies in its simple complex.



What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There were a few screens(UI) that needed to be implemented in this app. The First screen was a login screen, The second is the main database screen, lastly there is another screen that is pushed to the main database screen when adding items. The idea was an intuitive workflow for any user to be able to open and use the app. By following the android developers design for android guidelines this helped pave the way for what almost all other apps follow.




How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I first approached the process by deciding what application to build. Following this we needed to decide on the necessary features we needed to integrate to bring the app to life. Once we nailed down what was needed I started to design the UI and build the class structure that would run the application. Then, when the structure was built we just needed to build the functions that were necessary to run the app.

Almost all the apps that I have coded follow the same workflow. Basic requirements, layout, structure, code.



How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I did extensive testing as I moved from function to function. You can run tests like Junit testing to see if your code works but even if it sometimes works it doesn't work as you intend it to within the application itself. After running basic code tests to see if my input matched my output which it did, I still found that within the application that it wasn't showing up correctly and I had to optimize the code. Testing the code itself is important but doing physical functional tests where you actually run the code is just as important. Ideally it is good to automate some of these code tests to get the basic idea that it is working but it is wise to run the code and make sure its functioning as intended.



Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Most of my innovation came from structuring the classes and constraining the UI correctly to get it to work well together. I had to alter the flow of my classes slightly different from when I first had the structure laid out but I wouldn't have found the issues of things not working correctly until I worked through the code.



In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel as though my class structure followed by my functions shows maturity in my coding skills. With the accumulated knowledge and experience I have grown alot through the years. I remember when I used to put everything in one class under the main function. For very small applications this might be ok. But as we progress and excel into more complex applications its very important to break down what we are doing in a structured manner. Keeping classes concise to what their overall function is to be, writing specific functions to keep overall flow clean. Making the calls as necessary to get the desired result.
